# Project Description

For the PMR3402 - Embedded Systems course, offered in the first semester of 2025 at the Polytechnic School (EP) of the University of São Paulo (USP), this present project aims to develop the control of an embedded system that 
simulates the operation of a liquid propellant engine. This system uses a pressurized setup with electronically regulated gas input and a passive output (vent). It incorporates a pressure transducer, a control valve, and actuation elements, with the goal 
of creating a realistic test platform for dynamic pressure control. The project is part of a broader development effort, with potential application in real liquid propulsion systems, including future tests with 
monopropellants (HTP) and bipropellants (HTP + Jet-A) aimed at Brazilian space missions.
